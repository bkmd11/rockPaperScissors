""" Im sure that I still have some absolute failures in my formatting
that are clearly written out in pep 8 but I will figure that out
eventually

I am sure there is a cleaner way to present my json data....
But I am currently pleased with how this works.
I have grown bored with Rock Paper Scissors.
I believe I could make this grow with a GUI and images/graphics
but I am not sure that I will make that a thing in the future.
Time will tell
